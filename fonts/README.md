# Fonts Directory

This directory should contain font files used by the application.

## Required Fonts
- DejaVuSans.ttf
- DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf

## How to Add Fonts
1. Download the DejaVu Sans font family from https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/
2. Extract the files and copy both DejaVuSans.ttf and DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf to this directory
3. Restart the application

## Note
The application will try to find the fonts in multiple locations:
1. First in this directory
2. Then in the system fonts directory
3. Finally, it will attempt to use matplotlib's bundled DejaVu fonts
